# Motion-Planning-in-Dynamic-Enviroment

This is the repository for the RBE550: Motion Planning Project(Spring 2023) for Team NASA:
[Anuj Pai Raikar](https://github.com/22by7-raikar), Nikunj Reddy Polasani, [Ankush Singh Bhardwaj](https://github.com/ankushsingh999) and [Soham Aserkar](https://github.com/ssaserkar)

The aim of this project is to implement algorithms for Navigation of Robots through Dynamic Environments.

Primary Implementation will be performed using Python for scripting and [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news) for visualization.

Furthermore, we are exploring the implementation [OP-PRM](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2022.910859/full), [RRTx](http://ottelab.com/html_stuff/pdf_files/Otte.Frazzoli.IJRR15.pdf) and [Risk DT-RRT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8554117) on [ClearPath Husky](https://clearpathrobotics.com/husky-unmanned-ground-vehicle-robot/) using [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic) and [Gazebo](https://staging.gazebosim.org/home).

Current packages are related to ROS-Gazebo implementation.
