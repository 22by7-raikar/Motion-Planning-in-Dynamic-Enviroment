# Motion-Planning-in-Dynamic-Enviroment

This is the repository for the RBE550: Motion Planning Project(Spring 2023) for Team NASA:
[Anuj Pai Raikar](https://github.com/22by7-raikar), Nikunj Reddy Polasani, [Ankush Singh Bhardwaj](https://github.com/ankushsingh999) and [Soham Aserkar](https://github.com/ssaserkar)

The aim of this project is to implement algorithms for Navigation of Robots through Dynamic Environments.

To this end we have chosen to implement [OP-PRM](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2022.910859/full) and [RRTx](http://ottelab.com/html_stuff/pdf_files/Otte.Frazzoli.IJRR15.pdf) on [ClearPath Husky](https://clearpathrobotics.com/husky-unmanned-ground-vehicle-robot/) using [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic) and [Gazebo](https://staging.gazebosim.org/home).
